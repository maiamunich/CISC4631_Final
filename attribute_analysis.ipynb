    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook provides detailed analysis of individual attributes in the student dropout prediction dataset. It examines data quality, characteristics, and feature engineering opportunities for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Attribute Analysis**: Detailed examination of each feature's characteristics\n",
    "- **Data Quality Assessment**: Identification of missing values, outliers, and data anomalies\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of meaningful features for predictive modeling\n",
    "- **Statistical Analysis**: Understanding distributions and relationships between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "1. **Data Type Classification**: Categorize attributes by data type and measurement scale\n",
    "2. **Missing Value Analysis**: Quantify and visualize missing data patterns\n",
    "3. **Distribution Analysis**: Examine statistical distributions and identify outliers\n",
    "4. **Feature Engineering**: Create derived features and transformations\n",
    "5. **Correlation Analysis**: Identify relationships between features and target variable\n",
